**Forecasting a restaurant’s profit :**

Introduction:
In this post, we are able to look at linear regression as one of the main methods in systems studies and a method to be used to predict dining location franchise revenue. Furthermore, we are able to discuss the steps to construct a linear regression version of the basis on which urban populations predict monthly earnings. In this website I will manual you through the entire process including setting up the problem level and using gradient descent to optimize the parameters of our model
Installation
Follow this tutorial and you should have Python installed on your system. You can install Python and the necessary libraries by following the instructions on the official Python website (https://www.python.org/). In addition, you will need to install the following Python libraries.

NumPy: Core for scientific computing with Python.
Matplotlib: A plot library for plotting in Python.
Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.

You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following commands on your terminal or command prompt.
Install pip numpy matplotlib panda

Understanding the problem:
Let’s say you’re the CEO of a restaurant franchise looking to add new cities. You want to find cities where you can make a lot of money. For that reason, you will also get data on the population of major cities and the monthly profits of existing restaurants in those cities. The goal is to use this information to generate monthly profits for undiscovered cities, based on their size.

Building the model:
We start by projecting and plotting a data set to determine the urban population (in 10,000s) that expresses interest each month (in $10,000s). We will use Pandas and matplotlib to plot the data as a scatter chart to understand the nature of the population vs profit relationship below. Second, we create some elemental functions and apply linear regression from scratch. We calculate the cost function, which represents the error between our model’s forecast and the actual return. The goal is to maximize this cost function by changing our model parameters (slope and intercept). We use an optimization algorithm called gradient descent to iteratively update our parameters.

Training and evaluation of the model:
With the cost function and gradient descent in place, we train our linear regression model on the data. We start to over-set parameters such as model parameters, learning rate and number of iterations, use gradient descent to determine the optimal value of minimum cost and once the model is trained, evaluate its efficiency by scattering linear fits to the data , and explain the causal process. Furthermore, with larger populations outside the training area (e.g., new or different cities) and predicting outcomes, these predictions enable niche estimates of the potential benefits of expansion to new markets.

conclusion:
In this post, we showed how to build a simple linear regression model that predicts restaurant franchise profits based on city population. Linear regression is a powerful technique for making data-driven decisions and evaluating business opportunities. Knowledge of linear regression techniques allows you to interpret what your data says and make informed business decisions.
